# Welcome to HydroEnR!

This package is designed for members of Evidence and Risk who are developing PDM
models, applications can be extended into hydrological analyses. It enables;

  - Easy loading of data downloaded from WISKI
      - Carry out quality checks on these data  
      - Preserve metadata
      - Interactive visualisations
  - Aggregation of data by different periods and through various functions
    using rapid C++ based processes
  - Rain gauge weighting
    - Weighted average method
  - Peak detection in hydrological data
    - Various functions available
  - Conversion of flow and precipitation data to a volumetric measure over a 
    designated time step
  - Derivation of Thiessen/Voronoi polygons for use in our realtime flood forecast
    models
  - Download up-to-date meta data on EA gauges published on API
  - Carry out single site analyses
  - Determine baseflow from 15 minute resolution data
  - Review model performance using a greater range of objective functions than
    what is currently available
  - ARMA parameter inspection for stability in a real time forecasting
    context
      - Loads a local version of the shiny application

# Future Updates

  - Basic hydraulic equations such as the Manningsâ€™ equation
      - Import cross sectional data and carry out rudimentary analyses
  - Importing recent flow, stage and rain gauge data via the EAs API
  - Impute missing data into PE series
  - Trend detection in hydrological data
  - ESS in the near future

## Installation

You can install the development version of HydroEnR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonPayne88/HydroEnR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to fit a rating curve to observed data.

```{r example}
library(HydroEnR)
## basic example code
```

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
rating <- read.csv("C:/Users/jpayne05/OneDrive - Defra/Rating.csv")
attach(rating)
```

```{r rawplot}
# Plot raw rating data

plot(Discharge ~ Stage)

```

```{r rateOptimise}
# Optimise rating with a control points at 1.6m and 2.3m
rateOptim <- rateOptimise(Discharge, Stage, control = c(1.6, 2.3))
rateOptim
```

```{r fittedplot}
# Plot the fittings
ratingPlot(rateOptim, colours = c(2, 3, 4))
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
