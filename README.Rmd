# Welcome to HydroEnR!

This package is designed for members of Evidence and Risk who are developing PDM
models, applications can be extended into hydrological analyses. It enables;

  - Easy loading of data downloaded from WISKI
      - Carry out quality checks on these data  
      - Preserve metadata
      - Interactive visualisations
  - Aggregation of data by different periods and through various functions
    using rapid C++ based processes
  - Rain gauge weighting
    - Weighted average method
  - Peak detection in hydrological data
    - Various functions available
  - Conversion of flow and precipitation data to a volumetric measure over a 
    designated time step
  - Derivation of Thiessen/Voronoi polygons for use in our realtime flood forecast
    models
  - Download up-to-date meta data on EA gauges published on API
  - Carry out single site analyses
  - Determine baseflow from 15 minute resolution data
  - Review model performance using a greater range of objective functions than
    what is currently available
  - ARMA parameter inspection for stability in a real time forecasting
    context
      - Loads a local version of the shiny application

# Future Updates

  - Basic hydraulic equations such as the Manningsâ€™ equation
      - Import cross sectional data and carry out rudimentary analyses
  - Importing recent flow, stage and rain gauge data via the EAs API
  - Impute missing data into PE series
  - Trend detection in hydrological data
  - ESS in the near future

## Installation

You can install the development version of HydroEnR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonPayne88/HydroEnR")
```

## Example 1 - fitting rating curves

This is a basic example which shows you how to fit a rating curve to observed data.

```{r example}
library(HydroEnR)
## basic example code
```


```{r libs}
library(data.table)
library(sf)
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
library(dygraphs)
```

```{r data, echo = FALSE}
rating <- read.csv("C:/Users/jpayne05/OneDrive - Defra/Rating.csv")
attach(rating)
```

```{r rawplot}
# Plot raw rating data

plot(Discharge ~ Stage)

```

```{r rateOptimise}
# Optimise rating with a control points at 1.6m and 2.3m
rateOptim <- rateOptimise(Discharge, Stage, control = c(1.6, 2.3))
rateOptim
```

```{r fittedplot}
# Plot the fittings
ratingPlot(rateOptim, colours = c(2, 3, 4))
```

# Example 2 - Peak detection

```{r data1, echo = FALSE}

link <- ('O:/National Modelling and Forecasting/21_Strategic Delivery/Flood Forecast Modelling/03 Training/Peak Detection/Allington.csv')
allington <- read.csv(link, header = T)
allington$Time_stamp <- as.POSIXct(allington$Time_stamp,
                                   format = '%d/%m/%Y %H:%M',
                                   tz = 'GMT') # Change to a time format
```

```{r peaks}
peakscpp <- findPeaksCPP(allington$mAoD, m = 4500) # C++
results <- data.table(Position = peakscpp, allington[peakscpp,])  # Returns the rows where the peaks are found
results
```

```{r peak plot}
# Plot all points
plot(allington$Time_stamp, allington$mAoD, 
     type = 'l', 
     main = paste0('Peak detection where m = 4500'), 
     xlab = 'Time',
     ylab = 'mAOD')
points(results$Time_stamp, results$mAoD, col = 'red', pch = 19)
```

```{r peakloop}
# Integrate into loops
# Decide window over which to detect peaks
m <- c(1500, 4000, 6500, 8000)
# Include a threshold to filter results
threshold <- 33.75
# Change plot window too enable 4 plots 2x2
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
# Loop through the m values
for(i in seq_along(m)){
  p <- HydroEnR:::findPeaksCPP(allington$mAoD, m = m[i])
  results <- data.frame(Position = p, allington[p,])
  results_filter <- dplyr::filter(results, mAoD >= threshold)
  plot(allington$Time_stamp,
       allington$mAoD,
       type = 'l',
       main = paste0('m = ', m[i]),
       xlab = 'Time',
       ylab = 'mAOD')
  points(results_filter$Time_stamp, results_filter$mAoD, col = 'red', pch = 19)
  abline(h = threshold, col = 'red', lty = 2)
}

```


# Example 3 - Single site analysis

```{r buildwas, echo = FALSE}
link <- 'C:/Users/jpayne05/Desktop/Test_Data/buildwas.csv'
buildwas <- loadWISKI(link)
```

```{r monthplot}
# Monthplot of the Buildwas flow data
monthPlot(buildwas, name = 'Buildwas', polar = FALSE)
```

```{r amax}
# Retrieve the AMAX series
getAMAX(buildwas)
```

```{r QMED}
# QMED plots
# Can be stored in the environment
# Greater adaptability for users
plotQMED(buildwas)
```

```{r lmoments}
# Retrieve the l-moments
Ls(buildwas)
```

```{r extreme}
# Extreme value plot for buildwas
plotExtVal(buildwas)
```

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
